Layer 1: Red Natura 2000: ZEPA CyL
link to download shapefile: https://idecyl.jcyl.es/geonetwork/srv/spa/catalog.search#/metadata/SPAGOBCYLMNADTSPSZEP
The layer displays protected areas withn Castilla y Leon. Understanding the ecology in these protected areas, where most likely the predartor and prey densities are natual and unaffected by humans.
This can help with rewilding projects and undertasnding the natural predator and prey balance.
The attribute table shows us the names of the different proected areas as well as its size in hectares. Thios can help us determine the possible Topillo population within these reserves.

This layer shows the different types of crops grown in Castilla y Leon, this is helpful in understanding where Topillo can be located in the highest density based on crop preference:

Link to download geopackage: https://idecyl.jcyl.es/geonetwork/srv/spa/catalog.search#/metadata/SPAGOBCYLMNADTSAMCTC
Understanding different hunting grounds, where predator and prey balance has been disruptede may have ties with topillo increases. Maybe understaidng the species being hunted, as they could be predators to topillos or other prey species that the predators may depend on too foir a healthy population will be usefull.
